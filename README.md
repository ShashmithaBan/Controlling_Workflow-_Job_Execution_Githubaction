# GitHub Actions Workflow Control Demo

This repository demonstrates advanced GitHub Actions workflow control techniques including job dependencies, conditional execution, and environment protection.

## üöÄ Features

- **Job Dependency Management**: Control execution order with `needs` keyword
- **Conditional Workflows**: Run jobs based on specific conditions
- **Manual Triggers**: Support for workflow_dispatch with custom inputs
- **Matrix Strategies**: Parallel execution across multiple configurations
- **Environment Protection**: Production deployment approval requirements
- **Scheduled Workflows**: Automated daily maintenance tasks

## üìÅ Workflow Structure

### CI Pipeline (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
```yaml
name: CI Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch]
```

**Jobs:**
- **lint**: ESLint code quality checks
- **test**: Parallel testing across Node.js versions (16.x, 18.x, 20.x)
- **security**: npm audit vulnerability scanning
- **build**: Project compilation and artifact creation

### CD Pipeline (.github/workflows/cd.yml)
```yaml
name: CD Pipeline
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Deployment environment'
        required: true
        default: 'staging'
```

**Jobs:**
- **deploy-staging**: Automated deployment to staging
- **deploy-production**: Manual approval required for production
- **verify-deployment**: Health checks and verification

### Scheduled Workflow (.github/workflows/scheduled.yml)
```yaml
name: Scheduled Maintenance
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Daily at midnight
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Navigate to Actions ‚Üí CD Pipeline ‚Üí Run workflow
# Select environment (staging/production)
# Approve production deployment when prompted
```

### Local Development
```bash
npm test      # Run tests
npm run lint  # Code quality check
npm audit     # Security audit
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Required Secrets
- `STAGING_DEPLOY_KEY`: SSH key for staging environment
- `PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_KEY`: SSH key for production environment

### Environment Settings
Production environment requires:
- ‚úÖ Deployment approval
- ‚úÖ Reviewers
- ‚úÖ Protected branches

## üìã Example Usage

```yaml
# Example job dependency
deploy-production:
  needs: [test, build]
  environment: production
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
```
